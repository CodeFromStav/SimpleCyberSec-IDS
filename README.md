# SimpleCyberSec-IDS

Project Description:
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed to monitor network traffic and detect potential security threats.

Key Features:

1. Network Traffic Monitoring:
	- Capture and analyze network packets using Python's Scapy library or a tool like Wireshark.
	- Identify and classify network protocols, services, and potential threats.
2. Basic Intrusion Detection System (IDS):
	- Implement a simple signature-based detection technique.
	- Use open-source IDS tools like Snort or Suricata for real-time threat detection (optional).
	- Develop custom rules and signatures to detect specific attack patterns.
3. Alert Notification System:
	- Trigger notifications (e.g., email or SMS) when potential threats are detected.
	- Log all detected events and alerts for further analysis.

Tools and Technologies:

- Programming Language: Python
- Networking Tools: Scapy, Wireshark (optional)
- IDS Tools: Snort, Suricata (optional)
- Email Notification: SMTP, Twilio (for SMS)
- Version Control: Git
